            <p>Cape Town is the legislative capital of South Africa and the country's oldest city. It's known for its harbor, natural setting, and landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the Cape Colony. The metropolitan area has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Table Mountain National Park is within the city boundaries.
